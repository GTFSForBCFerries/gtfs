GTFS for BC Ferries

This was an unofficial GTFS feed for major BC Ferries routes accessible by Translink and BC Transit bus services.  Only routes between Metro Vancouver, Victoria, Nanaimo, and the Sunshine Coast were included.  Information on all other routes are available on the official <a href="https://www.bcferries.com/">BC Ferries website</a>.
